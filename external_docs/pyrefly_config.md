# Pyrefly Configuration

Pyrefly has a basic configuration that can (or will) allow you to customize your
Pyrefly runs without having to specify all of your arguments on the command
line.

NOTE: this is early in its development, so the options listed here are subject
to change in name, usage, type, quantity, and structure.

Configurations can be specified in a [TOML file](https://toml.io/en/) at the root of
your project (or elsewhere, as long as the path-based config options point to the right place) named
`pyrefly.toml`, with all configuration options in the top-level of the document.
You can also specify a configuration in a `pyproject.toml` under a `[tool.pyrefly]`
section. Other config names can be used when explicitly passing in the config file
name with the `--config`/`-c` flag, but they will not be automatically found by
[Configuration Finding](#configuration-finding).

Both absolute and config-relative paths are supported.

:::info
Want type error squiggles to show up in your editor by default? Try setting `python.pyrefly.displayTypeErrors` to `"force-on"` in your editor settings, create a `pyrefly.toml` file in your project root, or add a `[tool.pyrefly]` section to your `pyproject.toml` (can be empty).
:::

## Simple Configuration Example

Here's an example of a simple config. To see more complex examples,
including in a `pyproject.toml`, look at
[Example Configurations](#example-configurations), which show Pyrefly's default
config, as well as other ways you can set your configuration.

```toml
# set the directory Pyrefly will search for files to type check
project-includes = [
    "a", "b/c/d", "e"
]

# manually set the `sys.platform` Pyrefly will assume when type checking
python-platform = "linux"

# a table mapping error codes to an `is-enabled` boolean
[errors]
# disable `bad-assignment` errors
bad-assignment = false
# disable `bad-return` errors
bad-return = false
```

## Precedence in Options

[Configuration options](#configuration-options) are selected in the following order

1. CLI flags
    * Examples: `--project-excludes <value>`, `--python-version <value>`
2. Configuration options
    * Examples: (in a `pyrefly.toml`) `project-excludes = <value>`, `python-version = <value>`
3. Pyrefly defaults
    * See [Default `pyrefly.toml`](#default-pyreflytoml) for the default values used

## Type Checking Modes

Pyrefly has two different modes it can run in when type checking your project, which
correspond to different but useful ways we expect most people to interact with Pyrefly:

* **Project** mode: attempt to load a config, falling back to Pyrefly's default config when
  none can be found, and type check using that one config. This involves getting the
  [`project-includes`](#project-includes) and [`project-excludes`](#project-excludes) from the file, expanding the patterns,
  and type checking on those files.
  * Project mode is used whenever no files are provided with the CLI invocation.
* **Per-file** or **Single-file** mode: when given [`FILES...`](#project-includes) (and optionally [`--project-excludes`](#project-excludes))
  during a CLI invocation, expand the patterns and find the relevant config file for each
  file listed. `project-includes` and `project-excludes` are ignored from the config file,
  but it is used for all remaining config options.

## Configuration Finding

In both project checking mode and single-file checking mode (see [Type Checking Modes](#type-checking-modes)
for more info), we attempt to find a _project root_ from which to check each file, both for reading
config options and for import resolution. The project root is typically the directory containing the
configuration file. More precisely:

1. If a configuration file is provided with `-c`/`--config`, we use the directory the file is located in as the directory to check.
2. If no configuration file is passed, we perform an upward file search from the 'start location' to the filesystem root,
   looking in each directory for any of the following files: `pyrefly.toml`, `pyproject.toml`,
   `setup.py`, `mypy.ini`, and `pyrightconfig.json`. If we find one, we use the directory it's found in as the containing directory.
3. If no configuration file is found, we will still attempt to resolve imports by walking up the tree looking for a matching import. For example: when
   importing `from a.b.c import q`, if our project structure
   looks like `/x/y/z/a/b/c`, we can walk up the components of `a.b.c` to find a root at
   `/x/y/z`.

Note that only `pyrefly.toml` and `pyproject.toml` are parsed for config options, but we look for
additional files that mark the root of a project to aid import resolution.

For project checking mode, the 'start location' is current working directory. For single-file checking mode,
the start location is the directory containing each file to be type checked, and
we find the config for each file matched by the pattern provided.

If a `pyrefly.toml` is found, it is parsed and used for type checking, and will
return an error to the user on invalid types, syntax, values, or unknown config options.

If a `pyproject.toml` is found, Pyrefly will use the `[tool.pyrefly]`
section if it exists, otherwise it will assume a default config.
The same errors will be returned as when loading a `pyrefly.toml` if
the config is invalid.

### Providing a Config in Single-File Mode

Providing `-c`/`--config` in single-file checking mode disables the upward file search for config
files. All options are read from the provided config file except `project-includes` and
`project-excludes`, which are ignored.

## Configuration Options

The following section lists all recognized options that can be specified in a config
file or `pyproject.toml` Pyrefly config section.

### `project-includes`

The glob patterns used to describe which files to type
check, typically understood as user-space files.

This does not specify
[Import Resolution](./import-resolution.mdx) priority or the path an
import should be resolved from. See [`search-path`](#search-path) instead.

* Type: list of [filesystem glob patterns](#filesystem-globbing)
* Default: `["**/*.py*"]`
* Flag equivalent: `FILES...` argument
* Equivalent configs: `include` in Pyright, `files`/`modules`/`packages` in
  mypy
* Notes:
  * When overridden by passing in `FILES...`, we do not consult the
      relevant config file for what to use for `project-excludes`.
      If `project-excludes` should not use the default value, override it with the flag as
      well. This is because
      if multiple configs are loaded that conflict with `project-includes`, determining
      how to resolve checkable files gets complicated, and might become confusing to
      anyone attempting a type check if they're unaware of all the configs that will be
      used in the type check. Also, we get into a chicken-and-egg problem, where we
      don't know which files to exclude until we load all the configs we'll need,
      which requires loading all files, and imposes a large performance burden.
  * When a `project-includes` pattern does not match any files, we will return
      an error.
  * If you get an error about no matches for a directory when passing a glob as a CLI
      argument, try wrapping the glob in quotes to prevent eager shell glob expansion.

### `project-excludes`

The glob patterns used to describe which files to avoid
type checking as way to filter files that match `project-includes`,
but we don't want to type check.

The default value is appended to your `project-excludes` unless `disable-project-excludes-heuristics`
is set. See [`disable-project-excludes-heuristics`](#disable-project-excludes-heuristics) to fully replace
or remove `project-excludes`.

* Type: list of [filesystem glob patterns](#filesystem-globbing)
* Default: `["**/node_modules", "**/__pycache__", "**/venv/**", "**/.[!/.]*/**"]` +
  anything in your `site-package-path` (even from the interpreter) unless it would
  exclude items in your [`search-path`](#search-path).
* Flag equivalent: `--project-excludes`
* Equivalent configs: `exclude` in Pyright and mypy
* Notes:
  * While not explicitly part of `project-excludes`, there are several patterns that are
      filtered out of type checked files at our glob-implementation layer.
    * Dotfiles (any files that begin with a dot (`.<stuff>`)
    * Any files that don't end in `.py` or `.pyi`
    * Your [`site-package-path`](#site-package-path) (including paths queried from
          the interpreter)
  * It is an error if no files are returned from any `project-includes` because
      they are filtered out by `project-excludes` entries. We differentiate between
      an error from a `project-includes` that doesn't match any files, and an error
      from all `project-includes` getting filtered by `project-excludes`.
  * When overridden by passing in `FILES...`, we do not consult the
      relevant config file for what to use for `project-excludes`.
      If `project-excludes` should not use the default value, override it with the flag as
      well. See reasoning in [`project-includes` notes](#project-includes).
  * Your [`site-package-path`](#site-package-path) is added to your `project-excludes`
      automatically. If you are trying to perform type checking on a dependency in your
      `site-package-path` (i.e. `cd <site-package-path>/some_dependency && pyrefly check`),
      we recommend you pull and set up your dependency from GitHub, but you can achieve
      this on files in your `site-package-path` by setting `site-package-path = []` in
      your config.

### `disable-project-excludes-heuristics`

By default, Pyrefly includes several items in your [`project-excludes`](#project-excludes)
(see `project-excludes` for the default values). These items are path patterns we've
determined rarely have files that should be type checked, but can require a very long
time to crawl while enumerating files, or contain third-party code that you likely
don't care about errors in. When specifying `project-excludes`, we always append
these defaults to whatever is specified by CLI or in your configuration.

Sometimes, these preselected settings can interfere with your project's setup.
`disable-project-excludes-heuristics` lets you start from scratch, setting that default to `[]`,
so you can fully specify your `project-excludes` in case we get it wrong.

* Type: `bool`
* Default: `false`
* Flag equivalent: `--disable-project-excludes-heuristics`

### `search-path`

A file path describing the roots from which imports should be
found and imported from (including modules in [`project-includes`](#project-includes)). This takes
the [highest precedence in import order](./import-resolution.mdx#absolute-imports),
before `typeshed` and [`site-package-path`](#site-package-path). When a `project-includes`
type checked file is imported by another type checked file, we check all search roots to
determine how to import it.

* Type: list of directories specifying the root
* Default: import root
* Flag equivalent: `--search-path`
* Equivalent configs: `extraPaths` in Pyright, `mypy_path` in mypy
* Notes:
  * We automatically apply some heuristics to improve your experience, especially
      when no configuration is provided. See
      [`disable-search-path-heuristics`](#disable-search-path-heuristics) to disable
      this behavior, and [Search Path Heuristics](#search-path-heuristics) for the
      additional paths we add to your `search-path`.
  * Libraries should not be listed here, since they may override `typeshed`
      values for your whole project, and have different import semantics with
      respect to typing. See
      [Import Resolution](./import-resolution.mdx)
      for more information about how modules are imported.

### `disable-search-path-heuristics`

Disable any search path heuristics/additional search path behavior that Pyrefly will
attempt to do for you. This can be useful if Pyrefly is picking up the wrong import
paths for your project, for example, if you have multiple projects in the same
directory or use a monorepo setup with the import root outside of the directory
your configuration is defined in.

See [Search Path Heuristics](#search-path-heuristics) for more information on the
search paths that are automatically added, and are affected by this flag. For more
information on import resultion in general see the
[import resolution docs](import-resolution.mdx).

* Type: bool
* Default: false
* Flag equivalent: `--disable-search-path-heuristics`
* Equivalent configs: none
* Notes
  * To see what search path we find for your a given file in your project, or
      your project overall, you can run `pyrefly dump-config [<file>...]`.

#### **Search Path Heuristics**

Pyrefly adds extra search paths to your configuration behind-the-scenes to handle
the most common ways of setting up and configuring your project, on top of any
[`search-path`](#search-path) entries you may pass in through the CLI or
set in your config.

The two heuristics that are currently supported are:

1. Adding your import root to the end of your search path. Your import root is
   a `src/` directory in the same directory as a config file, the parent directory
   containing your config file if there's an `__init__.py` or `__init__.pyi` present
   _or_ the config file's directory itself if none of the previously mentioned directories
   or files can be found.
   See [Configuration Finding](#configuration-finding) for more information on
   what we'll find as a config file.
2. If no config can be found, each directory from the given file to `/` will be
   added as a fallback search path.

See more on [how Pyrefly does import resolution](import-resolution.mdx).

### `site-package-path`

A file path describing a root from which imports should
be found and imported from. This takes the lowest priority in import
resolution, after [`search-path`](#search-path) and `typeshed`.

See more on [how Pyrefly does import resolution](import-resolution.mdx).

* Type: list of directories
* Default: `./typings` + the result from [Environment Autoconfiguration](#environment-autoconfiguration), or
  `[]` if the Python interpreter cannot be queried
* Flag equivalent: `--site-package-path`
* Equivalent configs: none
* Notes:
  * The queried interpreter's site package paths will always be included in addition to any user-specified value,
      unless environment auto-configuration is turned off.
  * Ideally, this should not be set manually, unless you're using a venv, running one-off tests,
      testing specific behavior, or having trouble with [Environment Autoconfiguration](#environment-autoconfiguration).
      Setting this explicitly, especially when not using a venv, will make it difficult for your configuration
      to be reused between different systems and platforms.
  * If you're running into problems with editiable installations in your project,
      please read up on [editable installs with static analysis tools](import-resolution.mdx#editable-installs).

### `python-platform`

The value used with conditions based on type checking
against
[`sys.platform`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.platform)
values.

* Type: string
* Default: result from [Environment Autoconfiguration](#environment-autoconfiguration), or
  "linux" if the Python interpreter cannot be queried
* Flag equivalent: `--python-platform`
* Equivalent configs: `pythonPlatform` in Pyright, `platform` in mypy

### `python-version`

The value used with conditions based on type checking
against
[`sys.version`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.version)
values. The format should be `<major>[.<minor>[.<micro>]]`, where minor and
micro can be omitted to take the default positional value.

* Type: string of the format `<major>[.<minor>[.<micro>]]`
* Default: result from [Environment Autoconfiguration](#environment-autoconfiguration), or
  `3.13.0` if the Python interpreter cannot be queried
* Flag equivalent: `--python-version`
* Equivalent configs: `pythonVersion` in Pyright, `python_version` in mypy

### `conda-environment`

The name of the Conda environment to query when attempting to autoconfigure
Python environment values (`site-package-path`, `python-platform`, `python-version`).
See the [Environment Autoconfiguration section](#environment-autoconfiguration) for more
information. We query Conda with `conda info --envs`, then find the environment's interpreter in Environment Autoconfirugration.

We will query Conda for information about this environment, even when it's not sourced,
unless a Python environment (venv, Conda) is activated or `--python-interpreter-path` or
`--conda-environment` are passed in through the CLI.

**`conda-environment`, `fallback-python-interpreter-name`, `conda-environment`,
and `skip-interpreter-query` are mutually exclusive with each other.**

* Type: string of existing Conda environment name
* Default: none
* Flag equivalent: `--conda-environment`
* Equivalent configs: none
* Notes:
  * This enables the use of a non-local but customizable global environment without having to hard-code a path, which is not preferable on a shared project.

### `python-interpreter-path`

The Python interpreter to query when attempting to autoconfigure
Python environment values (`site-package-path`, `python-platform`, `python-version`).
See the [Environment Autoconfiguration section](#environment-autoconfiguration) for more information.

**`conda-environment`, `fallback-python-interpreter-name`, `conda-environment`,
and `skip-interpreter-query` are mutually exclusive with each other.**

* Type: path to executable
* Default: `$(which python3)`, then `$(which python)`, or none
* Flag equivalent: `--python-interpreter-path`
* Equivalent configs: `python_executable` in mypy
* Notes:
  * This executes the value present in the `python-interpreter-path` field without any checks. It could
      be a security risk if your `python-interpreter-path` is an arbitrary executable.
  * If you don't have a Python interpreter installed on your machine, we'll output an
      error letting you that we couldn't appropriately configure your environment.
      Configure `skip-interpreter-query` to skip the check and avoid the error.

NOTE: Ideally, this should not be set manually, unless you're using a venv, running one-off tests,
testing specific behavior, or having trouble with [Environment Autoconfiguration](#environment-autoconfiguration).
Setting this explicitly, especially when not using a venv, will make it difficult for your configuration
to be reused between different systems and platforms.

### `fallback-python-interpreter-name`

The Python interpreter, available on your `$PATH`, to use. Pyrefly will perform
`which <your command>`, and automatically fill in `python-interpreter-path` for you with
the found path. Pyrefly will automatically search for `python3` and `python` on your
path when this option and [`python-interpreter-path`](#python-interpreter-path) are unset if
[`skip-interpreter-query = false`](#skip-interpreter-query),
so this should primarily be used when you have a non-standard Python executable you want to
use.

**`conda-environment`, `fallback-python-interpreter-name`, `conda-environment`,
and `skip-interpreter-query` are mutually exclusive with each other.**

* Type: string of command to use
* Default: `python3`, then `python`, or none
* Flag equivalent: `--fallback-python-interpreter-name`
* Notes:
  * This executes the value present in the `fallback-python-interpreter-name` field without
      any checks. It could be a security risk if your `fallback-python-interpreter-name` is an
      arbitrary executable.
  * If you don't have a Python interpreter installed on your machine, we'll output an
      error letting you that we couldn't appropriately configure your environment.
      Configure `skip-interpreter-query` to skip the check and avoid the error.

### `skip-interpreter-query`

Skip querying any interpreters and do not do any
[Environment Autoconfiguration](#environment-autoconfiguration). This means that
Pyrefly will take hard-coded defaults for [`python-version`](#python-version`)
and [`python-platform`](#python-platform), and will use an empty
[`site-package-path`](#site-package-path). It's likely you'll want to override
these to match the environment you'll be running in.

**`conda-environment`, `fallback-python-interpreter-name`, `conda-environment`,
and `skip-interpreter-query` are mutually exclusive with each other.**

* Type: bool
* Default: `false`
* Flag equivalent: `--skip-interpreter-query`

### `typeshed-path`

Override the version of typeshed that's being used for type checking. The provided
path should point to the root of typeshed.

[Typeshed](https://github.com/python/typeshed) contains the type information for Python's
standard library, which Pyrefly uses for type checking and resolving both the most basic
types (like `object`, `str`, ...) and types/type signatures from stdlib modules.

* Type: path to typeshed
* Default: none (resolves to bundled typeshed)
* Flag equivalent: `--typeshed-path`

### `baseline`

Path to a baseline JSON file for comparing type errors. Errors matching the baseline
are suppressed, so only newly-introduced errors are reported. This is useful when
introducing type checking to a project for the first time, or when rolling out
changes that would otherwise produce many new errors at once.

To generate (or re-generate) the baseline file, run:

```
pyrefly check --baseline="<path to baseline file>" --update-baseline
```

See the [Error Suppressions docs](./error-suppressions.mdx#baseline-files-experimental) for
more details on how baseline files work.

* Type: path to a JSON file
* Default: none (no baseline)
* Flag equivalent: `--baseline`
* Notes:
  * `baseline` is a **project-level setting** and cannot be overridden in
      [`sub-config`](#sub-configs) sections.
  * Errors suppressed by the baseline file are still shown in the IDE.
  * Errors are matched with the baseline by file, error code, and column number.

### `errors`

Configure the severity for each kind of error that Pyrefly emits: `error`, `warn`, `ignore`.

:::info
Want type error squiggles to show up in your editor by default? Try setting `python.pyrefly.displayTypeErrors` to `"force-on"` in your editor settings, create a `pyrefly.toml` file in your project root, or add a `[tool.pyrefly]` section to your `pyproject.toml` (can be empty).
:::

* Type: Table of [error code](./error-kinds.mdx) to boolean representing enabled status
* Default: `errors = {}`/`[errors]`
* Flag equivalent: `--error`, `--warn`, `--ignore`
* Equivalent configs:
  [type check rule overrides](https://microsoft.github.io/pyright/#/configuration?id=type-check-rule-overrides)
  and [type evaluation settings](https://microsoft.github.io/pyright/#/configuration?id=type-evaluation-settings)
  in Pyright,
  [`enable_error_code`](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/config_file.html#confval-enable_error_code) and
  [`disable_error_code`](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/config_file.html#confval-disable_error_code)
  in mypy
* Notes:
  * Setting `<error-code> = true` means the error will be shown at default
      severity (or severity `ERROR` if the error is off by default). Setting
      `<error-code> = false` will disable the error for type checking.
  * If you want to disable type errors in IDE mode, you can also set
      [`disable-type-errors-in-ide`](#disable-type-errors-in-ide), which will
      automatically disable _all_ type errors and Pyrefly diagnostics in the IDE.

### `disable-type-errors-in-ide`

Disables type errors from showing up when running Pyrefly in an IDE. This is primarily
used when Pyrefly is acting in a language-server-only mode, but some kind of
manual configuration is necessary for it to work properly, or when you would
_only_ want to see type errors on CLI/CI runs.

* Type: `bool`
* Default: `false`
* Flag equivalent: none
* Notes: if you want to disable errors on CLI/CI runs as well, or if you're looking
  to turn on/off specific errors, you may be looking for the [`errors`](#errors) config
  option instead.

### `skip-lsp-config-indexing`

Disables automatic project indexing when running Pyrefly as a language server.
Enabling this may speed up LSP startup and reduce resource usage on large projects,
at the cost of some language server features that rely on a full project index.

* Type: `bool`
* Default: `false`
* Flag equivalent: none

### `replace-imports-with-any`

Instruct Pyrefly to unconditionally replace the given [`ModuleGlob`](#module-globbing)s
with `typing.Any` and ignore import errors for the module. For example,
with `from x.y import z` in a file, adding `x.*`, `*.y`, or `x.y` to this config will
silence those import errors and replace the module with `typing.Any`. If the module
can be found, its type information will still be replaced with `typing.Any`.

This is different from [`ignore-missing-imports`](#ignore-missing-imports), which only
replaces the import with `typing.Any` if it can't be found.

* Type: list of regex
* Default: `[]`
* Flag equivalent: `--replace-imports-with-any`
* Equivalent configs: `follow_imports = skip` in mypy

### `ignore-missing-imports`

Instruct Pyrefly to replace the given [`ModuleGlob`](#module-globbing)s
with `typing.Any` and ignore import errors for the module _only when the module
can't be found_.

For example, with `from x.y import z` in a file, adding `x.*`, `*.y`, or `x.y` to
this config will silence those import errors and replace the module with `typing.Any`
if `x.y` can't be found. If `x.y` can be found, then `z`'s type will be used.

This is different from [`replace-imports-with-any`](#replace-imports-with-any), which
will always, unconditionally replace the import with `typing.Any`.

* Type: list of regex
* Default: `[]`
* Flag equivalent: `--ignore-missing-imports`
* Equivalent configs: `ignore_missing_imports` in mypy
* Notes:
  * `errors = {missing-import = false}` (TOML inline table for `errors`) has similar behavior in Pyrefly, but ignores
      _all_ import errors instead of import errors from specific modules.
  * When a `.pyc` file is encountered and no source/stub files are available, Pyrefly automatically treats module as `typing.Any`.
      This behavior ensures that compiled Python files without available source code do not cause import errors and are handled permissively.

### `ignore-errors-in-generated-code`

Whether to ignore type errors in generated code. If enabled, generated files
will be treated as if they are included in `project-excludes`.
The generated code status is determined by checking if the file contents contain
the substring '<span>&#64;</span>generated'.

* Type: bool
* Default: `false`
* Flag equivalent: `--ignore-errors-in-generated-code`
* Equivalent configs: none

### `infer-with-first-use`

Whether to infer type variables not determined by a call or constructor based on their first usage.
This includes empty containers like `[]` and `{}`.

The default behavior is similar to Mypy - the type of the variable is inferred based on the first usage.

```python
x = []
x.append(1)  # x is list[int]
x.append("2")  # error!
```

Setting this to false will make Pyrefly infer `Any` for unsolved type variables, which behaves like Pyright.

```python
x = []  # x is list[Any]
x.append(1)  # ok
x.append("2")  # ok
```

* Type: bool
* Default: `true`
* Flag equivalent: `--infer-with-first-use`

### `untyped-def-behavior`

How should Pyrefly treat function definitions with no parameter or return type annotations?

By default, Pyrefly uses the `"check-and-infer-return-type"` behavior and will
check all function bodies, inferring the return type.

:::info
To provide inferred return types with `check-and-infer-return-type`, especially for
site-package paths (third-party packages), Pyrefly may need to load and analyze
more modules than you might otherwise see from mypy.

This may result in increased type check durations or an output showing more modules
analyzed than you expect. If this behavior is not preferred, you should set
`untyped-def-behavior` to `skip-and-infer-return-any` in your config or pass it in
as a flag.
:::

If this option is set to `"check-and-infer-return-any"`, then Pyrefly will still
check the function body but will treat the return type as `Any`.

If this option is set to `"skip-and-infer-return-any"`, Pyrefly will again treat
the return type as `Any`, but will also skip checking the function body. In this
case, Pyrefly will also infer `Any` as the type of any attributes inferred based
on this function body. This behavior is what PEP 484 specifies, although we do
not recommend it for most users today; since Pyrefly will not analyze the bodies
of untyped functions, language server functionality like showing types on hover
and finding definitions will not be available there.

:::info
`skip-and-infer-return-any` is mypy's default inference behavior, and how we will
attempt to migrate your existing mypy configuration when running `pyrefly init`.
See [Migrating from Mypy](migrating-from-mypy.mdx#mypy-config-migration) for more information on config migration.
:::

* Type: one of `"check-and-infer-return-type"`, `"check-and-infer-return-any"`,
  `"skip-and-infer-return-any"`
* Default: `"check-and-infer-return-type"`
* Flag equivalent: `--untyped-def-behavior`
* Equivalent configs:
  * The `"check-and-infer-return-type"` behavior emulates Pyright's default
      behavior.
  * The `"skip-and-infer-return-any"` behavior emulates mypy's default behavior.
  * The `"check-and-infer-return-any"` behavior emulates mypy's
      `check_untyped_defs` flag.

### `use-ignore-files`

Whether to allow Pyrefly to use ignore files in your project and automatically
add excluded files and directories to your [`project-excludes`](#project-excludes).
Similar to `project-excludes`, when explicitly specifying files to check, ignore files
are not used.

Pyrefly automatically searches for ignore files such as `.gitignore`, `.ignore`,
and `.git/info/excludes` in an upward search from your project root. Only the first of each
type of ignore file will be used, so if you have a `.gitignore` and `.git/info/excludes`
available, in different directories, Pyrefly will use both of them. Pyrefly will not
use global ignore files.

When multiple ignore files are found, Pyrefly checks them for excludes matches when
determining the files to type check in the order of `.gitignore`, `.ignore`, and
`.git/info/excludes`, taking the result of the first ignore file that has a match (either
allowlist or denylist). Regular
[`.gitignore`-style allowlist/denylist matching rules](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore) apply.

* Type: `bool`
* Default: `true`
* Flag equivalent: `--use-ignore-files`

### `build-system`

Pyrefly supports integrating into build systems to discover targets to type
check and their dependencies. It currently natively supports
[Buck2](https://buck2.build), as well as arbitrary build systems via custom
queries.

**Note that support for build systems is currently unstable, and breakage may
occur without notice. Support will likely be lower priority than other issues
for a while.**

#### Buck2

To configure Pyrefly to use Buck2 as a build system, add the following to your
`pyrefly.toml`:

```toml
[build-system]
type = "buck"
# Optional: The isolation dir for Buck2 to use.
isolation-dir = "pyrefly"
# Optional: Extra flags passed to Buck2.
extras = ["--verbose", "4"]
```

Behind the scenes, Pyrefly will run the
`prelude//python/sourcedb/pyrefly.bxl:main` [BXL
script](https://buck2.build/docs/bxl/) to get the necessary information about
the targets to type check.

Here is a description of the supported optional options:

**`isolation-dir`**

Name of the isolation dir to use when running the BXL query (see `buck2 --help`
or [Buck's documentation](https://buck2.build/docs/concepts/isolation_dir/) for
more information about isolation dirs).

Type: string
Default: none (Buck's own default is `v2`)

**`extras`**

Extra command line arguments passed to `buck2` when running the query.

* Type: list of strings
* Default: `[]`

#### Custom queries

Arbitrary build systems can be integrated using the `custom` type:

```toml
[build-system]
type = "custom"
command = ["some", "command", "..."]
```

Here is a description of the supported options:.

**`command`**

The command executed to query the build system about available targets.

Pyrefly will call this in the form `<command...> @<argfile>`, where `<argfile>`
has the format:

```text
--
<arg-flag>
<arg>
...
```

`<arg-flag>` is either `--file` or `--target`, depending on the type of
`<arg>`, and `<arg>` is an absolute path to a file or a build system's target.

The command should output a JSON file with the following structure:

```json
{
    "root": "/path/to/this/repository",
    "db": {
        "//colorama:py-stubs": {
            "srcs": {
                "colorama": [
                    "colorama/__init__.pyi"
                ]
            },
            "deps": [],
            "buildfile_path": "colorama/BUCK",
            "python_version": "3.12",
            "python_platform": "linux"
        },
        "//colorama:py": {
            "srcs": {
                "colorama": [
                    "colorama/__init__.py"
                ]
            },
            "deps": ["//colorama:py-stubs"],
            "buildfile_path": "colorama/BUCK",
            "python_version": "3.12",
            "python_platform": "linux"
        },
        "//colorama:colorama": {
            "alias": "//colorama:py"
        }
    }
}
```

Where:

* `root` is the absolute path the root of the repository.
* `db` is a map from target names to either:
  * library target definitions (e.g. `//colorama:py` and `//colorama:py-stubs` here)
  * target aliases (e.g. `//colorama:colorama` here)

For reference, the command invoked as part of the Buck2 integration is:

```sh
buck2 [--isolation-dir <isolation_dir>] bxl --reuse-current-config [<extras>...] prelude//python/sourcedb/pyrefly.bxl:main @<argfile>
```

* Type: list of strings
* Default: none (the option is required)

**`repo_root`**

Path to the root of the repository.

* Type: path
* Default: none

### `permissive-ignores`

Should Pyrefly ignore errors based on annotations from other tools, e.g. `# pyre-ignore` or `# mypy: ignore`?
By default, respects `# pyrefly: ignore` and `# type: ignore`.
Enabling this option is equivalent to passing the names of all tools to `enabled-ignores`.

* Type: `bool`
* Default: `false`
* Flag equivalent: `--permissive-ignores`

### `enabled-ignores`

What set of tools should Pyrefly respect ignore directives from?
Passing the names of all tools is equivalent to enabling `permissive-ignores`.

* Type: list of tools
* Default: `["type", "pyrefly"]`
* Flag equivalent: `--enabled-ignores`

### `sub-config`

Override specific config values for matched paths in your project. See
[SubConfigs](#sub-configs) for more information on the structure
and values that can be overridden here.

* Type: [TOML array of tables](https://toml.io/en/v1.0.0#array-of-tables) with a [SubConfig structure](#subconfigs)
* Default: `[]`
* Flag equivalent: none
* Equivalent configs: `executionEnvironments` in Pyright, per-module config options in mypy

### `recursion-depth-limit`

:::warning
This is a debugging option for investigating stack overflow issues. You should only use
this if Pyrefly is crashing with a stack overflow. If you encounter such a crash, please
[open an issue](https://github.com/facebook/pyrefly/issues).
:::

Maximum recursion depth before triggering overflow protection. When set to a non-zero value,
Pyrefly will detect when type checking recursion exceeds this limit and handle it according
to [`recursion-overflow-handler`](#recursion-overflow-handler).

* Type: integer
* Default: `0` (disabled)
* Flag equivalent: `--recursion-depth-limit`

### `recursion-overflow-handler`

:::warning
This is a debugging option. See [`recursion-depth-limit`](#recursion-depth-limit) above.
:::

How to handle when the recursion depth limit is exceeded:

* `"break-with-placeholder"`: Return a placeholder type and emit an internal error. Safe for IDE use.
* `"panic-with-debug-info"`: Dump debug information to stderr and panic. For debugging stack overflow issues.

* Type: one of `"break-with-placeholder"`, `"panic-with-debug-info"`
* Default: `"break-with-placeholder"`
* Flag equivalent: `--recursion-overflow-handler`

## Configuration Details

This section describes some of the configuration options, behaviors, or types in more depth, when
there are details shared between multiple config options or the information is more than what
can fit under a single config option description.

### Environment Autoconfiguration

Unless `skip-interpreter-query` is set, we'll attempt to query a Python interpreter to
determine your [`python-platform`](#python-platform) or
[`python-version`](#python-version) if they're unset. We also get a
[`site-package-path`](#site-package-path) from your interpreter to determine which
packages you have installed and append those to the end of any `site-package-path`
you've configured yourself, either through CLI flags or a config file.

We look for an interpreter with the following logic:

1. Use [`python-interpreter-path`](#python-interpreter-path),
   [`fallback-python-interpreter-name](#fallback-python-interpreter-name), or
   [`conda-environment`](#conda-environment) if any are set by a flag.
   More than one cannot be set in flags at the same time.
2. Determine if there's an active `venv` or `conda` environment. If both are active at
   the same time, we take `venv` over `conda`.
3. Use [`python-interpreter-path`](#python-interpreter-path),
   [`fallback-python-interpreter-name](#fallback-python-interpreter-name), or
   [`conda-environment`](#conda-environment) if either are set in a config file.
   Both cannot be set in a config at the same time.
4. Find a `venv` at the root of the project by searching for something that looks like a
   Python interpreter (matches `python(\d(\.\d+)?)?(.exe)?` regex), and looking
   for a `pyvenv.cfg` file in known locations. If we can't determine the root of your
   project with a config file or other well-known root marker file (e.g. `setup.py`,
   `pyrightconfig.json`, `mypy.ini`), this step is skipped.
5. Query `$(which python3)` and `$(which python)` (platform independent) to use
   a system-installed interpreter.
6. Fall back to Pyrefly's default values for any unspecified config options.

The config options we query the interpreter for are:

* `python-platform`: `sys.platform`
* `python-version`: `sys.version_info[:3]`
* `site-package-path`: `site.getsitepackages() + [site.getusersitepackages()]`

:::info
You can run `pyrefly dump-config` and pass in your file or configuration like you would
with `pyrefly check` to see what Pyrefly finds for your Python interpreter and
`site-package-path`, along with other useful config-debugging features.
:::

### Filesystem Globbing

We use a standard Unix-style glob, which allows for wildcard matching when specifying a fileset. It is similar
to regex, but more restricted given the subset of allowed syntax for paths on a filesystem. We currently only
allow matching files with a `.py`, `.pyi`, or `.pyw` suffix.

The globs provided are relative to the config, if one is found, or the current working directory otherwise.
Absolute path globs can also be provided, though this is generally not recommended, since it may not
be compatible with other systems type checking your project.

* We recognize the following wildcards:
  * `*` matches zero or more characters in a single directory component
  * `**` matches the current and any sub directories/files in those sub directories
  * `?` matches any one character
  * `[<pattern>]` matches any character or character range between the brackets (character range separated by `-`)
  * `[!<pattern>]` excludes any character or character range between the brackets and after the `!`
  * Note: `[]` can be used to match `?`, `*`, `[`, `]` literally (e.g. `[?]`), although these are invalid as part of a Python path.

We also support non-wildcard paths, so a relative (or absolute) path like `src/` will match all Python files under `src/`
or `src/my_file.py` will match `src/my_file.py` exactly.

Any directories matched will also have their `.py` and `.pyi` files recursively matched. `src/*` will match all files and
directories under `src/`, so therefore, we will recursively match everything under `src/`.

Examples:

* `src/**/*.py`: only match `.py` files under `src/`
* `src`, `src/`, `src/*`, `src/**`, and `src/**/*`: match all `.py` and `.pyi` files under `src/
* `?.py` and `[A-z].py`: match any file that looks like `<letter>.py`
* `src/path/to/my/file.py`: only match `src/path/to/my/file.py`
* `src/**/tests`, `src/**/tests/`, `src/**/tests/**`, and `src/**/tests/**/*`: match all `.py` and `.pyi` files in `src/`
  under a directory named `tests`

### Module Globbing

In some config options, we've added globbing for module paths. This is different from both path globs and regex,
in the sense that we're performing a match on a Python dotted import, such as `this.is.any.module`.
The only wildcard we recognize is `*`, which represents zero or more segments of a module path, unless it starts a glob,
in which case it must match one or more segments. The wildcard must be surrounded
by `.`, unless it is at the start or end of a module glob.

Examples:

* `this.is.a.module` would be equivalent to a regex like `^this\.is\.a\.module`. It will only match imports that look like
  `this.is.a.module`.
* `this.is.*.module` would become `^this\.is(\..+)*\.module$`. It would match:
  * `this.is.module`
  * `this.is.a.module`
  * `this.is.a.really.long.path.to.a.module`
* `*.my.module` would be equivalent to a regex like `^.+\.my\.module$`.
  * It would match:
    * `this.is.my.module`
    * `heres.my.module`
  * It will not match:
    * `my.module`
* `this.is.*` would be equivalent to a regex like `^this\.is(\..+)*`. It would match:
  * `this.is.my.module`
  * `this.is`

### `Sub-Configs`

`Sub-Configs` are a method for overriding one or more config options for specific files based on
filepath glob matching. Only certain config options are allowed to be overridden, and a need
to override other configs means you likely need to use a separate config file for your subdirectory.
You can have as many SubConfigs as you want in a project, and even multiple separate SubConfigs
that can apply to a given file when the `matches` glob pattern matches.

#### **SubConfig Allowed Overrides**

We currently allow the following config options to be overridden in a SubConfig:

* `errors`
* `replace-imports-with-any`
* `untyped-def-behavior`
* `ignore-errors-in-generated-code`

All SubConfig overrides _replace_ the values appearing in the 'root' or top-level of the
Pyrefly configuration.

Any configs that change the list of files we're type checking, Python environment, or where we look
for imports cannot be included in SubConfigs. Some other configs we also do not include because
we think they make it difficult to reason about your project type checks, but you can
[open an issue](https://github.com/facebook/pyrefly/issues) or make a pull request if you disagree
and would like to see the option supported.

#### **SubConfig Table Structure**

A SubConfig has two or more entries:

* a `matches` key, with a [Filesystem Glob](#filesystem-globbing) detailing which files the config
  applies to.
* at least one of the [SubConfig allowed overrides](#subconfig-allowed-overrides)

#### **SubConfig Option Selection**

Since you can have more than one SubConfig matching a file, we need to define a resolution order
to determine which SubConfig's option should be selected. Pyrefly does this by filtering
SubConfigs whose `matches` does not match the given file, then takes the first non-null
value that can be found in the order the SubConfigs appear in your configuration.

If no SubConfigs match, or there are no non-null config options present, then we take
the value in the 'root'/top-level Pyrefly config (or Pyrefly default if no value is specified).

#### **SubConfig Example**

For the following config, this how options would be resolved.

```toml
replace-imports-with-any = [
  "sympy.*",
  "*.series",
]
ignore-errors-in-generated-code = true

# disable `bad-assignment` and `invalid-argument` for the whole project
[errors]
bad-assignment = false
invalid-argument = false

[[sub-config]]
# apply this to `sub/project/tests/file.py`
matches = "sub/project/tests/file.py"

# any unittest imports will by typed as `typing.Any`
replace-imports-with-any = ["unittest.*"]

[[sub-config]]
# apply this config to all files in `sub/project`
matches = "sub/project/**"

# enable `assert-type` errors in `sub/project`
[sub-config.errors]
assert-type = true

[[sub-config]]
# apply this config to all files in `sub`
matches = "sub/**`

# disable `assert-type` errors in `sub`
[sub-config.errors]
assert-type = false

[[sub-config]]
# apply this config to all files under `tests` dirs in `sub/`
matches = "sub/**/tests/**"

# any pytest imports will be typed as `typing.Any`
replace-imports-with-any = ["pytest.*"]
```

* `sub/project/tests/file.py`
  * `replace-imports-with-any`: `["unittest.*"]`
  * `errors`: `{assert-type = true}`
  * `ignore-errors-in-generated-code`: `true`
* `sub/project/tests/another_file.py`
  * `replace-imports-with-any`: `["pytest.*"]`
  * `errors`: `{assert-type = true}`
  * `ignore-errors-in-generated-code`: `true`
* `sub/project/non_test_file.py`
  * `replace-imports-with-any`: `["sympy.*", "*.series"]`
  * `errors`: `{assert-type = true}`
  * `ignore-errors-in-generated-code`: `true`
* `sub/sub_file.py`
  * `replace-imports-with-any`: `["sympy.*", "*.series"]`
  * `errors`: `{assert-type = false}`
  * `ignore-errors-in-generated-code`: `true`
* `top_level_file.py`
  * `replace-imports-with-any`: `["sympy.*", "*.series"]`
  * `errors`: `{assert-type = true, bad-assignment = false, invalid-argument = false}`
  * `ignore-errors-in-generated-code`: `true`

### Conda and Venv Support

We plan on adding extra automatic support for [Conda](https://github.com/facebook/pyrefly/issues/2)
and [Venv](https://github.com/facebook/pyrefly/issues/1) at some point soon, but we haven't made
it around to doing this yet. If you would like to import packages from these in the meantime,
you can follow the following steps.

### Venv

If you have a venv set up locally, you can get Pyrefly working with it by having your venv sourced
in your shell (`source .venv/bin/activate`), and we will automatically pick up your installed packages. To pick
up your packages even when your environment isn't sourced, you can add `.venv/bin/python3` (or
`<path_to_venv>/bin/python3`) to your Pyrefly configuration under
[`python-interpreter-path`](#python-interpreter-path) or pass it in with the `--python-interpreter-path` flag.

### Conda

If you have conda set up locally, you can get Pyrefly working with it by having your Conda environment
sourced in your shell (`conda activate <environment>`), and we will automatically pick up your installed packages.
To pick up your packages even when your environment isn't sourced, you can query your environment's install
location with `conda env list`, and add `<conda_environment_path>/bin/python3` to your Pyrefly configuration
under [`python-interpreter-path`](#python-interpreter-path) or pass it in with the `--python-interpreter-path` flag.

## Example Configurations

This section displays an example config showing the usage of all config options listed above to make creating
your own easier, and to give you an easy place to start.

### Default `pyrefly.toml`

This is a configuration with the Pyrefly defaults. If you have an
interpreter installed, some of these values may be overridden.

```toml
###### configuring what to type check and where to import from

# check all Python files under the containing directory
project-includes = ["**/*.py*"]
# exclude some uninteresting files
project-excludes = ["**/node_modules", "**/__pycache__", "**/*venv/**", "**/.[!/.]*/**"]
# perform an upward search for `.gitignore`, `.ignore`, and `.git/info/exclude`, and
# add those to `project-excludes` automatically
use-ignore-files = true
# import project files from "."
search-path = ["."]
# let Pyrefly try to guess your search path
disable-search-path-heuristics = false
# do not include any third-party packages (except those provided by an interpreter)
site-package-path = []

###### configuring your python environment

# assume we're running on linux, regardless of the actual current platform
python-platform = "linux"
# assume the Python version we're using is 3.13, without querying an interpreter
python-version = "3.13"
# is Pyrefly disallowed from querying for an interpreter to automatically determine your
# `python-platform`, `python-version`, and extra entries to `site-package-path`?
skip-interpreter-query = false
# query the default Python interpreter on your system, if installed and `python_platform`,
# `python-version`, or `site-package-path` are unset.
# python-interpreter-path = null # this is commented out because there are no `null` values in TOML

#### configuring your type check settings

# wildcards for which Pyrefly will unconditionally replace the import with `typing.Any`
replace-imports-with-any = []
# wildcards for which Pyrefly will replace the import with `typing.Any` if it can't be found
ignore-missing-imports = []
# should Pyrefly skip type checking if we find a generated file?
ignore-errors-in-generated-code = false
# what should Pyrefly do when it encounters a function that is untyped?
untyped-def-behavior = "check-and-infer-return-type"
# can Pyrefly recognize ignore directives other than `# pyrefly: ignore` and `# type: ignore`
permissive-ignores = false

[errors]
# this is an empty table, meaning all errors are enabled by default

# no `[[sub-config]]` entries are included, since there are none by default
```

### Example `pyrefly.toml`

```toml
project-includes = ["src"]
project-excludes = ["**/.[!/.]*", "**/tests"]

## Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0    | Success - command completed without issues |
| 1    | User error - command completed but problems (e.g., type errors) were found |
| 3    | Infrastructure error - an error in the environment prevented the command from completing |
| 101  | Panic - Pyrefly encountered an internal error and crashed |
